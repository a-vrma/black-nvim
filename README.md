black-nvim
==========
A port of the [official black plugin][1] to use neovim's remote provider interface.

Differences:
- It runs asynchronously, so it won't block neovim while formatting the buffer.
- Checks if filetype is "python" before formatting.
- More robust error handling.
- This doesn't have all the features of the official one yet
  (you can't upgrade black from within neovim).
- Choose your own commands, only a function is exported.

`mistune.py` is used as a test file.

Options
-------
- `g:black_fast`
  Set to `1` to skip the AST check.
- `g:black_skip_string_normalization`
  Set to `1` to skip normalizing all strings to double quotes.
- `g:black_linelength`
  Set to an integer to tell black where to wrap around.

Setup
-----
You can set `Black()` to a command, keymapping, or just call it directly.
I set it like this so that alt-shift-f formats the buffer
(in after/ftplugin/python.vim):

```vim
if has('mac')
    nnoremap <buffer> √è :call Black()<cr>
elseif has('unix')
    nnoremap <buffer> <m-F> :call Black()<cr>
endif
```
